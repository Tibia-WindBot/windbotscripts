[SIZE=4][B]Description[/B][/SIZE]

It shows on your screen where runes on your crosshair will hit.


[SIZE=4][B]Configuration[/B][/SIZE]

Change [I]AnimateShape[/I] to [B][COLOR="#0066ff"]false[/COLOR][/B] if you don't want to animate the shape with the current rune image, making that will freeze the image shown.
Change [I]CommonShape[/I] to [B][COLOR="#0066ff"]true[/COLOR][/B] if you don't want to draw the rune shape, that will just show a "drown" icon on the affected squares.
