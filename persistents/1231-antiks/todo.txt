Find and fix the script to don't ignore the monster you're attacking if someone was found on the screen.
If someone was found in the screen and another person on safe list is in the list the antiks should ignore only the monsters for the safelist players (kinda impossible).
Change the name of the variables they don't have anything relationed with antiks safelist was meant to be a safe list and not the list of players you want to ks.
